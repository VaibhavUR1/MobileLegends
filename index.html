        <h1>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang May 2024 Hero Tier List</h1>
        <p>The list is based on the percentage of high-ranking elo. It does not mean that average, weak heroes are useless. Suppose someone picks a meta hero but he cannot cast the skill properly, but in the same battle you pick a non-meta hero but you know every bit how to use or counter, then obviously your winning chance is high, but try to pick S+, S, or A tier heroes to boost your stars in mythic and above, because fate will not always help you.</p>
